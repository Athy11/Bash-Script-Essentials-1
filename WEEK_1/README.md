## WHAT IS BASH?
The name is short for "Bourne Again Shell." It is also a command-line interpreter (shell) for Unix-based operating systems, including Linux and macOS. Bash allows users to interact with the operating system by executing commands, automating tasks using scripts, and managing processes. Moreover, it is an improved version of the original Bourne Shell (sh), developed by GNU.

## WHAT IS A SHELL?
A shell is a program that commands the operating system to perform actions. You can enter commands in a console on your computer and run the commands directly, or you can use scripts to run batches of commands. Shells like PowerShell and Bash give system administrators the power and precision they need for fine-tuned control of the computers they're responsible for.

## HOW BASH WORKS?
In Unix and Linux, everything is a file. That means you can use the same commands without worrying about whether the I/O stream, and the input and output comes from a keyboard, a disk file, a socket, a pipe, or another I/O abstraction.

### These commands help you check details about your system, such as OS type, user information, and available resources.
| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| uname  -a | Displays system information.         |
| whoami    | Shows the current user.              |
| date      | Displays the current date and time.  |
| df -h     | Shows available disk space.          |
| free -m   | Displays memory (RAM) usage.         |

### File and Directory Management
These commands help you create, navigate, copy, move, and delete files and folders.
| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ls                | Lists files in the current directory. |
| pwd               | Prints the current working directory. |
| cd directory_name | Changes to a different directory.     |

### Process and Task Management
These commands allow you to monitor running programs and stop unresponsive processes.
| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ps              | Lists running processes.  |
| kill process_id | Kills a specific process. |

### User and Permissions Management
These commands allow you to modify file permissions and ownership.
| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| chmod u+x file_name        | Changes file permissions (read, write, execute) for users. |
| chown user:group file_name | Changes file ownership to a specific user or group.        |


### System Utility Commands
These commands are used in the terminal or command-line interface (CLI) to help manage and control the operating system environment.
| Command | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| clear    | Clears the terminal screen, removing all previous output.  |
| exit     | Closes the terminal session or logs out of a shell.        |
| echo     | Prints a message or variable to the terminal.              |

## LET’S PRACTICE YOUR KNOWLEDGE
Now that you know Bash and how to navigate Git Bash, let’s test what you’ve learned!

Write a Bash script where you output a sentence of what you’ve learned about Bash.

The output may look similar to this:
Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell.
