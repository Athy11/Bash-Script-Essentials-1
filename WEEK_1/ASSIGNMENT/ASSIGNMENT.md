# ASSIGNMENT 1
Now that you know Bash and how to navigate Git Bash, let’s test what you’ve learned!

**DETAILS**

Write a Bash script where you output a sentence of what you’ve learned about Bash.

## SAMPLE CODE
**STEP 1:**
Create a file where you will write the code.
```bash
vim week1.sh
```

**STEP 2:**
Add the shebang (#!) to indicate which interpreter we will use (bash), and print your key takeaways using echo. Don't forget to save your file!
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo My key takeaways for this week is that Bash is great for learning DevOps!
```
